This is a repository to host the computational work done for emgillam's Bachelor thesis, re-creating functionality of Surface Evolver in WL.

There are three primary files: the computational methods for a cube (or other body) in space and a mound on a surface, and the files with these two models split. There is some overlap in the functions used for these two models. In the combined notebook, repetetive functions are commented out but left where they would appear in the split file.
